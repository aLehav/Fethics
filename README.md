Wonjun - Profile / Add Page

Anisha - Accept Page, Meetup Page

Adam's more in-depth notes:
Right now there is a log-in page that is very "shabby" for lack of a better term.
The sign-up page looks slighlty better but for the time being I say we focus on getting the log-in page done as when we share the project that's what'll pop up.
Person specific instructions:
Wonjun: the page currently labeled HomeScreen is the page that people will be routed to upon first logging in. That is what you should turn into the "Profile" Page. The next thing I'll work on is creating a working link for the add pages. For now, just port over the styling and make it work.
Anisha: Maybe try and add code to make a banner along the bottom that will be the way to navigate to the accept and meetup page. I will try helping with those when i can as well.
